# party_puzzle_challenge

#Requirements
* Must have a group of 10 or more people
* Based on n, you will randomly draw a card and place it on your forehead 
* There are repeats so everyone could have the same card, everyone's could be different, or it could be a combination of the two
* The goal is for at least <b>one person</b> in the group to guess correctly their card.  NOTE: Every game must have someone correctly guess their card.  There are other solutions which can get you close to 100% but we want this to be a foul-proof strategy which you will never lose

#Before the Game Begins
* As a team, you can come up with a strategy for how to approach the game
* Once the game begins, you cannot communicate with one another verbally, gestures, etc.
* The only thing you can see are the cards in front of you

#Good Luck!!
* I've included two hint files if you're stuck
* There is a <b>random_numbers.py</b> and <b>simulation.py</b> file that can be used to test things
* I've also included the <b>solution.py</b> file as well as a Jupyter Notebook (<b>solution.ipynb</b>) with visuals to understand things
* I'll add the solution in text in the upcoming future
