# party_puzzle_challenge

#Requirements
* Must have a group of 10 or more people
* Based on n, you will randomly draw a card and place it on your forehead 
* There are repeats so everyone could have the same card, everyone's could be different, or it could be a combination of the two
* The goal is for at least <b>one person</b> in the group to guess correctly their card

#Before the Game Begins
* As a team, you can come up with a strategy for how to approach the game
* Once the game begins, you cannot communicate with one another verbally, gestures, etc.
* The only thing you can see are the cards in front of you

#Good Luck
* I've included a hint file if you're stuck
* I've also included the solution using Python 
* I'll add the solution in text in the upcoming future
